# Complexes and more
This repository contains Mathematica files to work with simplicial complexes, (colorful) algebraic shifting, d-collapsibility and more.

So far there are just functions roughly organised into categories. 
Note that GitHub is not able to properly display Mathematica preview, so one has to download and open the nb file.
